    - Nezuko touched his shinny bell, and even from my eyes he disappeared.
    - I wasn't expect that...
    - Well, as soon as I turn my back to Nezuko and his merchandising army of his
      copies, I see something shine near a bush, almost in the curve of the Temple's
      back, among the vast vegetation and beautiful trees.
    - As I get closer, I see that it is an earring made up of a large, golden moon,
      and with two large blue jewels. The sun lit it up, making it look like two
      blue eyes through the grass.
    - Is this real gold and sapphires?

    - '"Eh-?"'
    - As soon as I crouch down and touch the shiny object, to my surprise, I don't
      see anything...
    - I pick it up as if nothing is wrong, listening to the tinkling of the pieces
      between my fingers...
