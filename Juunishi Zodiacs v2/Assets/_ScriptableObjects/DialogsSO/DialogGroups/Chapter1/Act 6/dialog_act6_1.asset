    - 'The next morning, to my surprise, when we reached the temple area, there was
      a small crowd clustered around someone. '
    - My gaze immediately goes to Nezuko, the only person visibly irritated, leaning
      against the corner with his arms crossed and with his bangs covering part of
      his face.
    - I wonder if he is escaping the crowd or the hot sun.
    - "\"Hmm? What's going on here? There's such a crowd here, it's unusual.\u201D"

    - "\u201CNezuko? - Hey! Wait for me!\""
    - Nezuko, with long, strong and determined steps, unfolds his arms and enters
      the crowd, pushing the public, to reach the center as quickly as possible.
    - While I followed him the best I could, apologizing for his attitude to the
      people who protested along the way.
    - 'In the midst of that gathering, we came across a very strange figure, with
      a strangely open smile, vibrant hair, and, over his shoulders, his great highlight:'
    - A giant snake in shades of emerald green, with two heads.

    - With a snap of his fingers and a laugh, the snake's heads turned towards the
      spectators, and a strong blue liquid began to be expelled from both mouths,
      hitting the crowd.
    - Nezuko pulls me violently against him, trapping me in his arms, and putting
      his back to the animal, preventing me from getting wet.
    - "Around me I hear grunts, and with my eyes fixed on the stone pavement, I see
      my pants stained with blood and blue liquid\u2026."
    - I feel my body freeze...
