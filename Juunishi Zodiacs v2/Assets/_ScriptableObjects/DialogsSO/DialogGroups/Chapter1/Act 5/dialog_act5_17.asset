    - We stayed on that bench for hours, until the temple got ready to close. We
      talked as if the world was going to end tomorrow, and for a moment, in Fushimi's
      eyes, it really did seem so...
    - He enthusiastically told me about the songs he had been writing about, about
      the brothers who were visiting and always distracted him,
    - 'and how his house was in disarray because of them. '
    - 'On my side, I told a bit about how it has been to live with Nezuko and how
      he has helped me to explore the world, until the topic of him being here came
      up:'
