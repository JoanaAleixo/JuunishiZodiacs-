      He is hugging someone, in a park. '
    - The ring, I can see it glint in his hand, now reflects the sunlight. In the
      distance, a dog barks and children laugh.

    _dialogueMessages:
    - Suddenly, the image is lost in a spiral... I hear crying, I smell the damp
      earth, rain runs down my face, and I grab the small object in an attempt to
      make sure it doesn't slip through my fingers.
    - "\u201CAh! My head-!\u201D"

    - "Light\u2026. I can see the sunset view of the festival from the perspective
      of someone in the crowd. He gives the ring a kiss, until someone calls him
      \u2013 it sounds like Nezuko's voice."
    - A cut is made in time, and then, among the wreckage, the small ring slips from
      his finger, bouncing across the ground and stops on the asphalt, ending up
      stained with blood, hidden in the shadows...
