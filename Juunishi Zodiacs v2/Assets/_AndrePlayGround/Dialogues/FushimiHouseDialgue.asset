    _dialogueMessages:
    - The lights are off; he must be at the festival.
    - Who would have thought that we would have a 15-year friendship... I still remember
      you coming up to me, on this same street, coming from school, inviting me to
      play, after you spent the whole day behind me and I ignored you...
    - I will always be grateful to you, Fushimi, my best friend, for everything you've
      done for me in my life, all your support, and for helping me to be who I am...
      I hope that one day you know how important you are, and you get everything
      that you deserve and want in your future...
    - And it's with one last look and a prayer, I say goodbye to you, Fushimi, you'll
      be better off without me.
