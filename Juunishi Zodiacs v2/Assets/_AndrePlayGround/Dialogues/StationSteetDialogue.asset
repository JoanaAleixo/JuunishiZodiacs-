    _dialogueMessages:
    - Even the station is calm, everyone is on the avenue.
    - It's strange to think that this railway line is the only thing that connects
      the 12 Aoishima Wards, even though they are next to each other. We are separated
      by walls to facilitate the distribution and management of Etheria energy (according
      to GenBase), powered by the District 0 reactor, which is responsible for all
      our electricity.
    - "If only this \u201Cgreat\u201D energy really helped us to protect from the
      Variants, instead of adulterated soldiers injected by it, maybe our lives would
      be better... Maybe that accident never happened..."
    - What am I saying?... they're just wild creatures, most likely they don't even
      know what they're doing... I just wish they'd taken me too...
